        <p><em>Thanks to advancements developed by NASA, today’s aviation industry is better equipped than ever to safely and efficiently transport passengers and cargo to destinations around the world.</em><br> In fact, every U.S. aircraft flying today, and every U.S. air traffic control facility, uses NASA-developed technology in some way.</p>

        <p style="color:black;">But those achievements aren’t enough for our aeronautical innovators.Pioneered by NASA, a new global aviation system for the 21st Century is emerging built on trailblazing technologies; advanced by entrepreneurial, forward-thinking companies; and driven by steady U.S. investment enabled by leaders in government and industry.</p>
        <p style="font-family:Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif; background-color:blanchedalmond;">With our government, industry and academic partners, NASA Aeronautics is working to make real a dream of air transportation that includes commercial supersonic travel over land and increasing use of environmentally friendly electricity to propel aircraft of growing size and range.<br>
            That vision includes the safe and widespread use of piloted, remote-controlled and fully autonomous aircraft of all sizes to move people and packages wherever they need to go – perhaps within a dense urban environment, out to a nearby international airport, or to a rural town on the prairie.</p>

            MY LIFE MY RULES
            IF YOU ARE BAD I'M YOUR DAD
            DAD'S LITTLE PRINCESS
            HAVE A CHEERFUL DAY
            ALWAYS BE HAPPY
            “Man must rise above the Earth—to the top of the atmosphere and beyond—for only thus will he fully understand the world in which he lives.” 
            “Learning to fly an airplane taught me a way of thinking, an approach to problem-solving that was applicable and effective."
